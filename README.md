# Reflection on "The Cycle of Socialization"

I strongly resonated with how Bobbie Haro, in “The Cycle of Socialization,” describes the way we come to associate ourselves with a unique set of identities—we are born into them without a choice. However, it does not end there. We are “socialized” to play unequal roles in society based on the identities we are predisposed to. I think this aspect of the picture is often overlooked. Growing up, I frequently saw and heard blame placed on those who identified with disadvantaged groups, including women, people with disabilities, and low-income households. I often encountered rhetoric rooted in the just-world fallacy—“they are poor because they are lazy,” or “they must be atoning for sins from a past life”—used to justify inequality by family members, at school, and in the media.

In “Defining Racism,” Beverly Tatum endorses the definition of racism as “prejudice plus power.” I believe this notion also applies to other forms of oppression, like the ones I witnessed growing up. The unequal roles assigned to marginalized identities hinder equal representation, especially in positions of power. This system of oppression persists because the information we receive about underrepresented identities is often assumed by those in power or intentionally omitted. As Tatum says, assumptions come not only from what we’ve been told but from what has been left unsaid, such as the history of oppression. These distortions are passed down and shape the everyday assumptions people make about underrepresented groups.
Haro points out that these assumptions are part of a structure larger than just our families. Tatum further explains that they become part of the “cultural messages and institutional policies and practices.” The cycle perpetuates as prejudice prevents people from oppressed identities from accessing power, while those in power overlook inequality to maintain their advantage, which is often based on identities they inherited at birth.

What saddens me most is that oppression becomes internalized by people from underprivileged identities. The system not only fails to address them justly in policy-making and cultural representation but also causes them to become their own oppressors. This, to me, is the most excruciating consequence of socialization based on identity. People from disadvantaged backgrounds subconsciously reiterate the stereotypes and assumptions imposed by those in power, invalidating their own experiences and feelings. Conforming to societal norms often means playing into stereotypes that define their public identities. When they gather the courage to challenge these norms, they are frequently blamed for their group’s perceived inferiority. They face a painful dilemma: remain silent and perpetuate the cycle, or confront their internalized oppression and risk criticism from both within and outside their community for disrupting the status quo.

As Heather Dalmage suggests, people are not born genetically predisposed to hatred against other identities. I want to extend Leah Donnella’s description of “mixedness” to argue that one’s understanding of their identity depends heavily on culture and experience, not biology. However, culture and experience also draw boundaries between in-groups and out-groups. These boundaries are influenced by collective memories of events like colonialism and discrimination, as well as sentiments passed down by parents and grandparents against specific groups. They are reinforced by literature, songs, photographs, and other cultural artifacts that stem from significant historical events shaping how groups view themselves.

While such events are important and must never be forgotten, preoccupation with them can make it difficult to recognize a fundamental truth: people are born into identities without choice. This preoccupation can also make it hard to listen to perspectives that challenge long-held beliefs. Whether you’re holding onto your beliefs or sharing your perspective, I agree with Malcolm X that we should not condemn others for thinking or acting differently than we believe they should. Our timelines are all different—who we encounter, when, and how varies for everyone. Naturally, our worldviews differ as well.

No matter how much we differ, one thing is constant: we cannot live alone in this world. To maintain intergroup dialogue, it is crucial to remind ourselves of how the cycle of socialization works. We are born into identities without choice, socialized into roles based on those identities, and our perceptions of others are shaped by culture, experience, media, and institutions. Only by recognizing the systems of oppression and advantage that shape these identities can we transcend the boundaries we draw between ourselves and truly listen to and support one another.
